Salsify Coding Challenge README

Reference

  I used this website as a reference for HTTP PUT with the HTTParty library:
    https://gist.github.com/julianeon/cd5b112dd569ff7efd07

  I used this website for documentation on using NET::FTP:
    https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/ftp/rdoc/Net/FTP.html

  I used this page for figuring out how to convert XML to JSON:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1530324/ruby-xml-to-json-converter

3rd Party Libraries

  I used NET::FTP for accessing the FTP server, HTTParty for PUTing to the API, and pry for debugging.
  I chose NET::FTP by doing a google search and looking at some Stack Overflow posts. I initially chose
  NET:HTTP to PUT to the API, but after running into some problems with it and discovering that
  the documentation was not good for the PUT method I decided to use a different one.
  After doing a google search for alternative, I decided to use HTTParty instead because I found an example
  on a GitHub gist that worked correctly for me.

Time & Future Improvements

  This exercise took me approximately 3 hours including time for breaks, planning, research, and debugging.
  If I had additional time to work on the exercise I would like to add more extensive and informative
  error handling for the file reading and API access. Also, I would like to see if I could get the HTTP PUT to
  work in place of HTTParty. Depending on the size of the codebase after these improvements I would
  consider separating pieces of the script into separate classes or methods to make the main part of the code
  more readable.

Critique

  If I were to critique my code I would say that is sufficient for the task at hand.
  I think it could benefit from being restructured to use separate functions and classes
  if the codebase was larger, but that keeping everything in a script-style format was appropriate for
  a small task like this one.
